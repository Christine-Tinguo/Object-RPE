# Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Segmentation

This is an implementation of instance segmentation used in [Object-RPE] (https://sites.google.com/view/object-rpe). The original version is from [matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN). The model generates bounding boxes and segmentation masks for each instance of an object in the image. It's based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and a ResNet101 backbone.
